-- Example: Complex query with multiple features
-- Demonstrates JOINs, aggregations, and filtering

/*
 * This query combines multiple SQL features:
 * - JOIN operations
 * - Aggregate functions
 * - WHERE clause with comparisons
 * - GROUP BY and HAVING
 * - ORDER BY with LIMIT

-- Alternative: Simple aggregation by role
-- SELECT role, COUNT(*) as total
-- FROM './data/users.csv'
-- GROUP BY role
-- ORDER BY total DESC;
